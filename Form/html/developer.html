            that allow a developer to create, test and
            debug software.
            
            Current browsers provide integrated developer tools, which allow to inspect a website. They let users
            inspect and debug
            the page's HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, allow to inspect the network traffic it causes, make it possible to
            measure it's
            performance, and much more.</p>

        <p class="about_html">HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines
            the meaning and structure of
            web content. Other technologies besides HTML are generally used to describe a web page's
            appearance/presentation (CSS)
            or functionality/behavior (JavaScript).</p>
            <p class="about_html">"Hypertext" refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either within a single
                website or between websites.
            Links are a fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading content to the Internet and linking it to pages
            created by other
            people, you become an active participant in the World Wide Web.</p>
            <p class="about_html">An HTML element is set off from other text in a document by "tags", which consist of the
                element name surrounded by  and ">" . The name of an element inside a tag is case insensitive. That is,
                it can be written in uppercase, lowercase, or a mixture. For example, the  tag can be written as
                Title, TITLE, or in any other way.</p>
